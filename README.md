# IP Tracker [![Python 3.x](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.x-yellow.svg)](http://www.python.org/download/)
Simple python discord bot that can geolocate ips using an api, this code is messy and we are not willing to keep support for this code in the future!

# Self hosting
You can find guide how to do that in IP Tools [wiki](https://github.com/lixeri/IP-Tools/wiki)
